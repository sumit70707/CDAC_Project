# 📦 Microservices Breakdown

## 1️⃣ Service Discovery (Eureka Server)

Responsible for:
- Service registration
- Service lookup
- Dynamic load balancing

All microservices register themselves with Eureka.

---

## 2️⃣ API Gateway

Responsibilities:
- Centralized routing
- JWT validation filter
- Secure endpoint filtering
- Load balancing using Eureka

---

## 3️⃣ Auth Service

Responsibilities:
- User registration
- Login
- JWT token generation
- Role management
- OTP generation and verification

Redis Usage:
- OTP storage with expiry
- Temporary authentication cache

Security:
- BCrypt password encryption
- Stateless JWT authentication
- Role-based authorization

---

## 4️⃣ Product Service

Responsibilities:
- Add product
- Update product
- Delete product
- View product catalog
- Wishlist management

Redis Usage:
- Store and cache wishlist products
- Reduce DB reads for frequently accessed wishlist data

Features:
- Validation
- Custom exception hierarchy
- Pagination support

---

## 5️⃣ Order Service

Responsibilities:
- Cart management
- Order placement
- Order validation
- Payment orchestration

Features:
- Circuit breaker on Payment Service
- REST communication
- Kafka producer for order events

---

## 6️⃣ Payment Service

Responsibilities:
- Process payment
- Update order status
- Publish payment result event

Features:
- Circuit breaker fallback
- Idempotent payment handling

---

## 7️⃣ Notification Service

Responsibilities:
- Consume Kafka events
- Send email notifications
- Notify order/payment status

Features:
- Kafka Consumer
- Asynchronous processing

---

# 🗄️ Database Design

Each service maintains its own schema.

## Auth Database
- users
- addresses

## Product Database
- products
- wishlists

## Order Database
- carts
- cart_items
- orders
- order_items

## Payment Database
- payments

## Notification Database
- notifications

---

# 🔄 Order Placement Flow

1. User logs in via React App
2. JWT token generated by Auth Service
3. Request goes through API Gateway
4. Order Service validates cart
5. Order Service calls Payment Service
6. Payment Service processes payment
7. Kafka event published
8. Notification Service consumes event
9. Email notification sent

---

# 🔐 Security Implementation

- JWT (HMAC SHA-256)
- Gateway-level JWT validation
- Role-based access control
- BCrypt password hashing
- OTP verification with Redis
- Stateless authentication

---

# ⚡ Redis Implementation

### Auth Service
- OTP storage with TTL
- Temporary login verification cache

### Product Service
- Wishlist caching
- Frequently accessed product optimization

Benefits:
- Reduced DB load
- Faster response time
- Scalable session-independent caching

---

# 🔄 Communication Strategy

## Synchronous
- REST Template / WebClient
- Service discovery via Eureka

## Asynchronous
- Apache Kafka
- Event publishing and consumption
